Simple Project TODO
---------------------------------------

Simple Project TODO is a single-file program (EXE on Windows) that allows easy, 
and nice looking TODO for any project.

The TODO list is stored in the project's folder as JSON, so it's easy to dig in
should the user decide to stop using Simple Project TODO. This also allows for
easy integration into Version Control.


Simple Project TODO consists of really two parts. A "servlet", a mini-web server,
and some HTML5 code. When you run SimpleProjectTODO from your project's directory
it launches your default web browser, greeting you with the TODO.

You can enter your project's name, and then begin adding new Tasks.

Once you complete a task, just click the Checkmark.

Tasks are color coded, so it's easy to identify what needs to be done and everything
that has been completed.


Simple Project TODO is a step up from using a text file, but it does not go
overboard. Packing the whole thing into a single, portable EXE allows easy
usage and integration into many platforms and environments.


FUTURE PLANS: Obviously this is currently a Work In Progress as-is. It is mainly
GUI focussed, so it can't be used from the command-line. It might be nice to
have a simple CLI, just to make this program even more portable.




Usage:
	Copy SimpleProjectTODO.exe to your project's folder. You can also install
	it to a system path (although I find it easier to just copy to each project).

	Run SimpleProjectTODO.exe. Your web browser should open, displaying 
	the Simple Project TODO panel.

	Click "Project" to add a project name.

	Click the empty blue rectangle to add a new task. Type in the task's description
	and click the Plus on the left.

	When you've completed a task, click the Checkmark.

	You can edit a task's text by just clicking on the text.

	There is no need to save. Changes are saved automatically to "todo.json" in the
	project directory.
